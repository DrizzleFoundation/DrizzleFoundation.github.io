* <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle/+bug/946058">Bug fixed</a>: In master master setup, slave plugin would try to apply transactions originating from itself. (Joe Daly)

* Updated <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/">docs</a>. Check out comprehensive replication documentation! (Daniel Nichter, Henrik Ingo, Muhammad Umair, Brian Aker, et.al.)
* Cleanups to drizzle and drizzled --help output and error messages. Standardize plugin names. (Daniel Nichter, Mohit Srivastava)

<strong>Installing Drizzle 7.1.32-rc</strong>

The source tar package is available from our <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/+milestone/7.1.32-rc">Launchpad download area</a>.<strong> </strong><a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/from_source.html" target="_blank">Please see the manual on how to install Drizzle 7.1.32-rc from source tar package.</a>

The Ubuntu packages are available from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Edrizzle-developers/+archive/ppa" target="_blank">Drizzle PPA</a>. Instructions on <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/ubuntu.html" target="_blank">how to install from the PPA are in the Drizzle manual</a>.

CentOS 6 packages are available from <a href="http://download.drizzle.org/7.1/" target="_blank">download.drizzle.org</a>. <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/redhat.html" target="_blank">Instructions on how to install them with yum are in the Drizzle manual.</a>

Note: For Drizzle 7.1.32-rc, only 64-bit packages were built for RedHat/Centos. Please let us know if there is demand for 32-bit packages (such as by commenting to this blog post.)

<strong>Known issues</strong>

All of the optional plugins are packaged in their own package. These are named drizzle-plugin-*. If a plugin is installed, it is also configured to load by default. (see /etc/drizzle/conf.d/<wbr>pluginname.cnf) However, not all plugins actually work without further configuration. These plugins will cause the server startup to fail. The workaround is to either configure the plugin to work, or uninstall it if you don't want to use it. (<a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/drizzle/+spec/plugin-standards" target="_blank">Related blueprint</a>) In short, you should only install the plugins you want to use. Don't install all available plugins.</wbr>

Please post bugs on the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle">Drizzle bug tracker</a> and questions and general feedback to <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Edrizzle-discuss/">drizzle-discuss mailing list</a>.
