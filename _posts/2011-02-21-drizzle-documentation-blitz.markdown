We are designating this Wednesday February 23rd as Drizzle documentation review day.  All the Drizzle developers will be reviewing our current <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org" target="_blank">documentation</a> for technical errors, missing sections and general improvements. We encourage anyone who would like to improve the quality of our docs to join in this effort, contact us on #drizzle on Freenode, send some email to the discussion list (drizzle-discuss@lists.launchpad.net) or <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle" target="_blank"> file a bug</a> if you spot anything we could improve on.
