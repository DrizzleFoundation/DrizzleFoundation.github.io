Drizzle source tarball based on <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/aloha">build 1088</a> has been released. The change log can be viewed <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/aloha">here</a>. While continuing to do a lot of great code clean up, this release also features work by Padraig who has got a great start working on extracting I_S out into plugins.

We also now support <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">protobuf 2.1</a> except when using gcc 4.4 or if you are running on Solaris. Monty is working on getting a patch into protobuf 2.1.1 for the gcc 4.4 issue. He is also working closely with the SunStudio engineers to get that issue resolved as well.
