We are very happy to announce Drizzle Developer Day is coming again this year. Similar to last year it will be the Friday after the MySQL users conference, April 16 - 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  We are still working on the exact location and will let you know as soon as possible, most likely it will be at or very close to the Santa Clara convention center.  We invite anyone interested in providing feedback, implementing new features, helping to fix bugs, or just wanting to learn more about Drizzle to attend.  

Please sign up at   <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/Drizzle_Developer_Day_2010_signup" target="_blank">http://drizzle.org/wiki/Drizzle_Developer_Day_2010_signup</a>. Space will be limited. 

Also, to make this day a success, please provide your input on discussion topics at <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/Drizzle_Developer_Day_2010" target="_blank">http://drizzle.org/wiki/Drizzle_Developer_Day_2010</a>

Hope to see you there!
