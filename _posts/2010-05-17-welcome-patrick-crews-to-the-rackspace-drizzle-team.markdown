We are very happy to announce another addition to the <a href="http://rackspacecloud.com" target="_blank">Rackspace</a> Drizzle team today. Patrick has been a QA Engineer at MySQL / Sun / Oracle since 2007, where he focused on code coverage tools, maintaining and updating the MySQL test suite, and testing with the <a href="http://launchpad.net/randgen" target="_blank">Random Query Generator</a>.

Prior to that, he worked in Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida's data warehousing division, did internships for the Mayo Clinic and the NFL as a student, and spent 5 years in the Navy doing electrical work on the mighty P-3C Orion aircraft.

Patrick currently lives in Jacksonville, FL with his wife and a crazed Boston Terrier.  He holds an M.S. in computer science from the University of North Florida and is a MySQL certified developer.  In his free time, he likes to run, read, and think of ways to work with obscenely large amounts of data.

Welcome to the team Patrick!
