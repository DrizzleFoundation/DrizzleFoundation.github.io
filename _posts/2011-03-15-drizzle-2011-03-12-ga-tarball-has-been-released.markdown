  content: What I like about Drizzle is that it has no stored procedures, triggers,
    or views - three staples of MySQL and other relational databases - and, in a blow
    to a large chunk of the computing and IT establishment, it doesn't run on Microsoft's
    Windows. Also, there's no embedded sever.Instead, Drizzle is a microkernel built
    using C++ that relies on plug-ins to expand its features. It has inherited plug-ins
    from MySQL for the storage engine API, logging in, authentication, replication,
    network protocols, and scheduling but these have all been re-written.

<a href="http://drizzle.org/">Drizzle</a> source tarball version 2011.03.13 has been released.  <strong>This is a GA release</strong> (and just in time for the ides of March) &gt;: )

* Apologies for any confusion with version 2011.03.12 (see the url for this entry...) and announcements - there was an issue with the release process that necessitated cutting another tarball.  2011.03.13 is good to go

It's been a long and crazy road to get to this point and the team would like to thank everyone that has helped us get here.  Every patch, bug report, and thought-provoking question has been invaluable in getting Drizzle this solid.

For quick summaries of what has been going on with the team, please check out Andrew Hutching's terrific '<a href="http://www.linuxjedi.co.uk/?tag=last-week-in-drizzle">Last Week In Drizzle</a>' series

For a general rundown of how we differ from MySQL, see <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/mysql_differences.html">here</a>

Here is a partial list of what you can find inside:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/index.html">Documentation</a> is sphinx-based and available in-tree or online.  It should be noted that they are licensed under Creative Commons!</li>
	<li><a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/replication.html">Replication</a> solutions will be log based.  Both file-based and <a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2010/12/06/replication-log-inside-innodb/">innodb-table based</a> versions of the log are available and have been heavily tested / validated.</li>
	<li>Native replication available via the <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org/plugins/slave/index.html">slave plugin</a>.  This solution utilizes the innodb-based replication log and has been subjected to significant testing.  Check out a simple example <a href="http://dshrewsbury.blogspot.com/2011/03/simple-drizzle-replication-example.html">here</a>.  You can check out David Shrewsbury's replication related blog posts <a href="http://dshrewsbury.blogspot.com/search/label/replication">here</a></li>
