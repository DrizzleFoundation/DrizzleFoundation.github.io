    Hi there,

    I am the port maintainer for Drizzle on FreeBSD (http://bit.ly/gbyv03), so I am willing to take over this task.  Can you point me to the details of what needs to be done?

    Thank you,
    Greg Larkin

    help.  \nWe have some issues where our test suite won't run on either 8.0 (I think)
    and 8.1 (for certain in certain locations...long paths were an issue, I think).\n\nAs
    for the particulars, I will start a thread on our discussion list with you to
    bring folks more knowledgeable than myself in on this.  \n\nThanks again!"

    Hello,

    I'm also interested to keep the FreeBSD port up and running.  Would be happy to give a helping hand for Drizzle and FreeBSD.

  content: Would love it if lib drizzle could be upgraded to 1.0 on the FreeBSD port
    (Even the normal drizzle package is mid-2010), I can't use the nginx drizzle module
    with mysql because of a bad packet bug with libdrizzle 0.8 and I'm having the
    utmost difficulty getting libdrizzle-1.0 installed with gmake (keeps saying nothing
    needs to be done).

Hi everyone!  Just wanted to announce that Drizzle will stop supporting FreeBSD moving forward.  We will continue to build on the platform, but will no longer run our test suite.

If  someone in the community wants to take over maintenance of Drizzle on FreeBSD, we would be delighted!  It is simply a matter of it taking too much of our limited time to keep things running on this system.

UPDATE:  As you can see below, we've had the FreeBSD port maintainer offer to help us keep things going.  Go open source! : )
