Get ready for  Drizzle Developer Day 2011!  Similar to the previous  years it will be the Friday after the MySQL users conference, April 15 - 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  We are still working on the exact location and will let you know as soon as possible, most likely it will be at or very close to the Santa Clara convention center.  We invite anyone interested in providing feedback, implementing new features, helping to fix bugs, or just wanting to learn more about Drizzle to attend.  

Make sure to <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEcwZnNlQ2dqRTB2bWJkVWxJUlRiWlE6MQ" target="_blank">sign up here</a> as soon as possible  as space will be limited.  

Hope to see you there
-Lee
