Next week, the week of January 10th, the Drizzle team is going to focus solely on fixing and cleaning up bugs.  We are getting very close to our GA release of Drizzle7 for the end of February and everything is shaping up nicely. This will be a good opportunity to up the bar on our quality for the release. 

Right now we have 153 open bugs. We have created a spreadsheet for better viewing of open bugs and will update this periodically as bugs are fixed.  You can view the spreadsheet <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AvgIZQGYvj2GdHp4THJqXy16QW9zNmwzUE8ydEFCTEE&hl=en&authkey=CM75m7wE#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.  The second tab has some stats that shows totals of bugs by assignee,  priority, milestone and status. 

There are plenty of bugs there of all levels and many that are unassigned,  so if you are so inclined please feel free to jump in and help out.  If you see a bug you would like to tackle that is already assigned, contact the current assignee as there is more than enough to go around. Besides fixing bugs we could use some help with verifying bugs as several of these bugs are old and perhaps may not be valid any more.

See <a href="http://inaugust.com/post/79" target="_blank">Monty's blog</a> for a great summary of bug workflow in Drizzle and launchpad.
