We made a lot of really great progress this past week during our bug blitz.  Overall Drizzle stability and quality has greatly improved as a result of the blitz.  Here are some of the highlights:
	<li>Started the week with ~150 open bugs,  2 critical and 19 high</li>
	<li>As of today, we are at ~125 bugs with 5 in Fix Committed state and in the queue to be merged</li>
	<li>Looking at priority we now have 0 critical, 9 high</li>
	<li>Over the week we fixed 41, marked 5 as won't fix, 11 as invalid and 1 as duplicate</li>
	<li>A majority of our crashing bugs were fixed or marked as no longer valid</li>
	<li>There were 21 new bugs filed this week, higher than normal but it was the result of some great feedback from the Rackspace DBA's who are giving Drizzle a spin.</li>

Yes, the numbers won't add up exactly as I had to track this by hand so a few may have slipped by in either direction. Thanks for everyone who helped out, this really made a big impact.  While 125 still seems like a lot of bugs, if you look closely many of the bugs marked as Low or Wishlist are code clean up  type bugs or very minor issues. Look for the Drizzle team to start doing bug blitz's on a regular basis.
