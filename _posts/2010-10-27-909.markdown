    Hi.  Here are some links that should be helpful:

    HailDB website:
    http://www.haildb.com/

    Embedded Innodb (which HailDB is based upon):
    http://www.innodb.com/wp/products/embedded-innodb/

    Hope that helps.  You can always ask in #drizzle when Stewart is around if you'd like more info and whatnot.
