Drizzle Developer Day 2011 will be held Friday April 15th at the Santa Clara Hilton Hotel in the Coastal Ballroom (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=4949+Great+America+Pkwy+Santa+Clara,+CA+95054&aq=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.094886,80.244141&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=4949+Great+America+Pkwy,+Santa+Clara,+California+95054&z=16">map</a>) which is right across from the Santa Clara Convention center. We will get started around 9:30 a.m. and should finish up by 4:00 p.m. 

We invite anyone interested in providing feedback, implementing new features, helping to fix bugs, or just wanting to learn more about Drizzle to attend. Make sure to <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEcwZnNlQ2dqRTB2bWJkVWxJUlRiWlE6MQ" target="_blank">sign up here</a> as soon as possible as space is limited.  

Hope to see you there
