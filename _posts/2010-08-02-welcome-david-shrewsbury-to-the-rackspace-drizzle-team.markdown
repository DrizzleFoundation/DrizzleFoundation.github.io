We are very happy to announce that David Shrewsbury is joining the Rackspace Drizzle team today. David has been a steady community contributor to the Drizzle project so we are very excited to have him on board full time working on Drizzle.

David has a M.S. in Computer Science from Appalachian State University and currently lives in Durham, North Carolina. In his previous lives,  David has been a developer, database architect, and even worked as a MySQL Support Engineer focusing on Cluster support.

When not trying to wrap his head around some obscure piece of code, David can often be found either on the golf course, reading books from the dustier corners of the library, or sampling the latest microbrew.

Welcome to the team David!
