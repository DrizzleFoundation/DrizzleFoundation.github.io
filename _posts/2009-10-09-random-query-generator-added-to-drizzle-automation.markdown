We now have the <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/RandomQueryGenerator" target="_blank">Random Query Generator</a> running as part of our <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/Automation_Documentation" target="_blank">automated testing framework!</a> Thanks to <a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/" target="_blank">Stewart</a> for kick starting the port for Drizzle and Philip Stoev and Bernt Johnsen of the MySQL team for merging in our changes. I'm still trying to figure out all the bells and whistles and fine tuning but we have several canned configurations running and even found a bug in Drizzle as a result of some of the tests. You can see the results on the <a href="http://gorf.tangent.org/hudson/view/Drizzle/" target="_blank">Drizzle dashboard.</a> I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improving the setup.
