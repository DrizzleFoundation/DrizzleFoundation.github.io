Drizzle source tarball based on build 1144 has been released.  This release contains a very nice feature from Eric that allows you to run drizzled as a  console. It looks and feels like the normal command line client, but there are no sockets involved.  See Eric's note on the <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/drizzle-discuss/msg05061.html" target="_blank">discussion list</a> for complete details.

The download file and change log can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/bell" target="_blank">here</a>.
