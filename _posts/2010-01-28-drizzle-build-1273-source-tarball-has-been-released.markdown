Drizzle source tarball based on build 1273 has been released.  This marks completion of our <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/bell">Bell milestone</a>. We made a lot of great progress and improvements during the Bell milestone, one of the main goals was to make sure data loss does not occur so that active testing can now occur.  While Bell has been completed, upgrading will continue to require dump/load , so hopefully we will nail that down soon and let you know when it is ready. 

Stay tuned for more information on goals and features for the our next major milestone which will be code named Cherry. 

The Drizzle download file and change log can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/bell" target="_blank">here</a>
