Drizzle source tarball based on build 1117 has been released. This marks the milestone for our Aloha release. While there was a ton of miscellaneous work done in Aloha, the major areas we were able to focus on were:

    * Protocol improvements
    * Start of replication infrastructure (Make sure and check out <a href="http://jpipes.com/">Jay's blogs</a>)
    * Pluggable discovery implementation
    * Information Schema work
    * Automated Valgrind, SLOC, LCOV and Sysbench Regression
    * Continued Plugin Rework

The download file and change log can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/aloha">here</a>.  Thanks very much to everyone who contributed to this major milestone!

As Jay noted in a previous <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/drizzle-discuss/msg04869.html">email today</a>, the next release - <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/bell">Bell</a> will be in January 2010. Let us know your feedback on the goals and tasks that we came up.
