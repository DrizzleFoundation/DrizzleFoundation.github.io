Please join me in welcoming Andrew Hutchings to the Rackspace Drizzle team. Andrew has been a very active community contributor to the Drizzle project so we are very excited to have him on board now working on Drizzle. Well ok, his first official day is tomorrow but he has been very busy with contributions over the past number of weeks!

Andrew lives in a small town in Northamptonshire, England with his wife and two sons.  Known as LinuxJedi to many online, he is a community code contributor to several open source projects.  He was previously a Senior MySQL Support Engineer for Sun/Oracle specialising in MySQL Cluster.  He is also the co-author of a book on the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/mysql-5-1-plugins-development/book" target="_blank">MySQL Plugin API</a>. You may have already seen his <a href="http://www.linuxjedi.co.uk/" target="_blank">blog</a> on Planet Drizzle. 

Welcome to the team Andrew!
