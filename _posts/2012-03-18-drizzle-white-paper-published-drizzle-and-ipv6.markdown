<a title="Drizzle white papers" href="http://www.drizzle.org/tags/white-papers">Drizzle white papers</a> highlight unique features and designs in Drizzle, and give you examples of how to use them. We are proud to announce that we have today published our first white paper: <a href="http://www.drizzle.org/content/drizzle-and-ipv6">Drizzle and IPv6</a>.

This white paper will explain how Drizzle supports IPv6. The support for IPv6 networking was added to Drizzle early on and is available already in the first Drizzle 7 release. The Drizzle 7.1 release also adds the support for an IPV6 Data Type, to provide a way of storing IPv6 addresses in the database that is both user friendly and efficient. As an introduction we will also cover the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses and the reasons for transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 addresses.

With this white paper we wish to thank the Google Summer of Code program for supporting Drizzle. The IPV6 data type was developed as a GSOC 2011 project by Muhammad Umair, with Mark Atwood mentoring. The IPv6 networking support was developed by Brian Aker and Eric Day, at the time employed by Sun Microsystems.
