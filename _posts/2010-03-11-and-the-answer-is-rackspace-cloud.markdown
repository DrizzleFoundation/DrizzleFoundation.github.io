A lot of you have been wondering where the Drizzle developers who were working at Sun have landed after the Oracle acquisition. As I'm sure you have seen by now we are very happy to now be working on Drizzle at <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace Cloud</a>. Check out the blogs from <a href="http://oddments.org/?p=282" target="_blank">Eric</a>, <a href="http://www.joinfu.com/2010/03/happiness-is-a-warm-cloud/" target="_blank">Jay</a>, <a href="http://inaugust.com/post/77" target="_blank">Monty</a> and <a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2010/03/11/continuing-the-journey/" target="_blank">Stewart</a>.
