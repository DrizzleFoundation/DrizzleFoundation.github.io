Check out <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/686178.html" target="_blank">Brian's blog</a> which details all the features we are targeting for our next release, code name <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/cherry" target="_blank">Cherry</a>. Actually in launchpad these are termed "series" and within each series we are defining two week milestones to track our progress. Currently looking to complete Cherry by the end of April.
