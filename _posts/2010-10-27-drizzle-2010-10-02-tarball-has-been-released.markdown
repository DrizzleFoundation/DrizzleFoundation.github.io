    @Steffen  For me I am using it for two purposes, the first is in test cases where I am selecting values inside of the database into variables, and then executing them from statements that I have already stored as variables (a binary SET operation from the client would make this a bit sharper, but that is a bit out of the scope of what I was needing at the time).

    The second thing I am using them for is to make sure that some of our work internally is allowing for re-entrance on the session level. Why? I've had a compile of Drizzle working with a perl interpreter internally just so that I can execute near the data (I don't expect to ever merge the perl bits BTW, I dislike having anything like perl that core to the kernel). I do want to make sure it continues to work though.

Drizzle source tarball, version 2010.10.02 has been released.

This is a beta-quality release.

Many thanks to everyone for the patches and bug reports.Â  Please keep them coming!

In this release:
<ul>
	<li>Added user locks</li>
	<li>Continued code cleanup and refactoring</li>
	<li>Removed two dead plugins (bad schedulers)</li>
	<li>Added documentation on replication</li>
	<li>Added options to the drizzled/messages/transaction_reader program, which allows us to convert transaction.log content into SQL: /path/to/transaction_reader path/to/transaction.log = SQL output of log contents.
We can now:
* view raw log ouput (rather than converted to SQL)
* view contents of the log from a specific message onward
* view the contents of a specific message</li>
	<li>Added UTF8 test cases for Tamil</li>
	<li>Added <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/drizzle/+spec/add-execute">EXECUTE</a> functionality:
We can do:
* SET @VAR = "SELECT 1";
* EXECUTE @VAR;
* EXECUTE "SELECT 1";</li>
</ul>
The Drizzle download file can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/elliott/2010-10-25">here</a>
