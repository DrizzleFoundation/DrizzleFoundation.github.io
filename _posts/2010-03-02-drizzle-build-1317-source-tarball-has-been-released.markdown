Drizzle source tarball based on build 1317 has been released. There was a lot of clean up and removal of dead code from Stewart as he continues to work on integrating embedded InnoDB. Brian added a data_dictionary schema and also did a complete rewrite of the SHOW commands.

The Drizzle download file and change log can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/cherry/2010-03-01" target="_blank">here</a>.
