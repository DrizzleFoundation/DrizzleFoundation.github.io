  content: I increasingly think we should just cut over to using dbqp instead of test-run.pl
    for everything. Even *I* am tending to use it by default now!

Drizzle source tarball, version 2011.05.17 has been released.
This is a release of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/fremont">Fremont</a> series and is a development release.  Our stable <a href="../../2011/04/2011/03/15/drizzle-2011-03-12-ga-tarball-has-been-released/">GA release</a> can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/+milestone/2011-03-14">here</a>.

A bit of a thin release, but we have been quite busy with ramping up for Google's Summer of Code and some general reorganization after the news you may have read <a href="http://www.linuxjedi.co.uk/?p=193">here</a>.  Lots of cool things are incubating though - improvements to replication, <a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2011/03/23/multi-tenancy-drizzle/">catalogs</a> (native multi-tenancy support? what?), and <a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2011/04/21/http-json-alsosql-interface-to-drizzle/">other cool bits</a> (You can also read more <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2011/april/reflections-mysql-conference-part-iii-my-own-activities">here</a>.  Henrik details some of Stewart's heroics toward the end of the post).

Please keep the feedback and bugs coming, they help a lot and it is great to see people using the software!

<ul>
	<li>Various fixes and updates around libdrizzle (thanks Marc Isambart)</li>
