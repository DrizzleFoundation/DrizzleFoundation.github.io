Please join me in welcoming Marisa Plumb to the Rackspace Drizzle team. Marisa joins us as our Documentation writer to help organize and make some sense out of our <a href="http://docs.drizzle.org" target = "_blank">current documentation</a> as well as help to beef up our documentation going forward. I've already volunteered to introduce Marisa to many of the users in our community so she can get some feedback on what is working and what might be lacking. 

Marisa's background is in writing, teaching, and web development. Her current research and projects investigate the influence of data analysis and technical literacy on media narratives and messaging. In recent roles, she has been a proponent of transparency and open source solutions in government and academia.

Marisa's IRC handle is marisap. Welcome to the team Marisa!
