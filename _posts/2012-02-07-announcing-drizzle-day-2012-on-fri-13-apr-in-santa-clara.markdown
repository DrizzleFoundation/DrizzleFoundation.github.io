The Drizzle Team would like to welcome you to our 4th Drizzle Day, to be held on Apr 13 at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Santa Clara.

Admission to Drizzle Day is free, however we recommend that you consider making a voluntary donation between 50 - 150 USD to our SPI account to cover for the costs of this conference: <strong><a href="http://www.drizzle.org/content/donations">click here to donate</a></strong>. Note that if you are expensing your travel and Percona Live attendance with your employer anyway, you can also expense this payment as a conference fee.

Reflecting the fact that Drizzle 7 has now been out for a year, and Drizzle 7.1 will be released before the conference, the content for this Drizzle Day is geared more towards end users than before. You can learn about unique Drizzle features like true multi-tenancy support, the HTTP JSON interface, and more! Toward the end of the day we also have content that might interest potential contributors and you can end the day by talking to Drizzle developers who are happy to guide you in both using Drizzle as well as becoming an active community member.

The Drizzle Day follows right after the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/">Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo</a> where you will also find Drizzle talks, BoFs and a booth in the Exhibition hall dot-org-pavilion. <em>We would like to thank Percona for sponsoring the Drizzle Day by covering a large part of the costs as well as marketing the event as an official side-conference to PLMCE.</em>
