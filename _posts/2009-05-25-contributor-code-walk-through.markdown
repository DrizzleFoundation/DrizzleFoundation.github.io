	<li>The build, debugging and testing toolset</li>
	<li>Quick How-To for using Launchpad and Bazaar effectively</li>
	<li>Overview of how the source code is structured (different modules, etc)</li>
	<li>Details about some of the larger structures and classes used in Drizzle and how they work together</li>
	<li>Explanation of how to create a skeleton plugin and test cases for your plugin</li>
	<li>Q&A</li>
</ul>
