Hi there.  In case you happened to miss it, <a href="http://blog.drizzle.org/2011/03/15/drizzle-2011-03-12-ga-tarball-has-been-released/">Drizzle went GA</a> ; )

The response has been tremendous...it is all kinds of rewarding to see new faces in IRC and to have feedback from new users.  We've seen lots of new visitors to the blog and our download numbers have been most satisfying.  Thank you for giving Drizzle a spin.

Here are some quick bits of news that you may have missed:
<ul>
	<li>LinuxJedi's<a href="http://www.linuxjedi.co.uk/?p=167"> Last Week In Drizzle - the GA version</a> - Andrew covers most of the interesting news from last week.</li>
	<li>Patrick Galbraith of Blue Gecko (and DBD::Drizzle fame) has provided some <a href="http://www.bluegecko.net/drizzle-3/blue-gecko-drizzle-amis-now-available/">Drizzle AMI's for everyone to try out their new favorite DBMS</a> ; )</li>
	<li>Drizzle has once again been accepted for <a href="http://wiki.drizzle.org/GSOC_2011">Google's Summer of Code</a></li>
</ul>

We'd also really love to have more feedback on the software.  Any thoughts from anyone deploying Drizzle?  Any questions / issues from trying it out?  Anything else?  If so, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/drizzle">IRC</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~drizzle-discuss">emails</a> and <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/drizzle/+addquestion">launchpad</a> will help put us in touch : )
