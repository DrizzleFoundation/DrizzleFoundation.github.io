We are very excited to <a href="http://blog.drizzle.org/2010/09/29/drizzle-build-1802-tarball-has-been-released/" target="_blank">announce</a> our Beta release of Drizzle. We have come a long way since <a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">Brian</a> introduced Drizzle back at OSCON in 2007. I joined the project when it was kicked into high gear at Sun in 2008 and its been a great road traveled with many more great accomplishments to come.   

And yes we are calling this release Drizzle7! Our goal is to have a GA version in February. So please give it a spin and try it out, we are looking for your feedback and input to help polish and improve Drizzle. Here are some links you might find useful as you get started:

<li>Email questions/comments/feedback to drizzle-discuss@lists.launchpad.net</li>
