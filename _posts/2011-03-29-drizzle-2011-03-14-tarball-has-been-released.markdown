This is the first release of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/fremont">Fremont</a> series and is a development release.  Our stable <a href="http://blog.drizzle.org/2011/03/15/drizzle-2011-03-12-ga-tarball-has-been-released/">GA release</a> can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/+milestone/2011-03-14">here</a>.  Future releases to the Elliott series will be announced appropriately.
