Last month drizzle community was excited to be joined by 4 students as part of <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" target="_blank">Gsoc</a>. As the summer of code has already kicked off , its time to better know the students and take a look on what they will be working on this summer, with their mentors and drizzle community at large.

<a title="Padraig's blog" href="http://posulliv.com/" target="_blank">Padraig O'Sullivan</a> (posulliv) is a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at university of maryland. Padraig would be working on re-implementing Information_Schema for drizzle, his plans to tackle the problem can be found at the <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/GSOC_Information_Schema" target="_blank">project page</a> on <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki" target="_blank">drizzle wiki</a>. <a href="www.jpipes.com/index.php" target="_blank">Jay pipes</a> would be mentoring padraig during his time as SOC student with drizzle. Padraig is from ireland which explains his love for beer :), before coming to US for post grad he was an intern at oracle dublin. Padraig is intrigued by scalable and distributed systems. Other than computers and code padraig likes to play guitar and drink beer. Padraig goes by the nick "posulliv" on twitter, IRC and launchpad.

Biping Meng (ABi) is a final year computer science student at nanjing university, china. Biping will work on refactoring and streamlining the <a title="wiki page" href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/GSOC_Pool_Threads_Scheduler" target="_blank">Pool of threads scheduler</a> with <a href="www.oddments.org/">Eric day</a> and Jay Pipes as mentors. Abi is interested in search engine and natural language processing and to that effect he did his internship at <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> which is a popular search engine in china. Biping likes to play table tennis and badminton but mostly likes to code, his team was among top 20  in microsoft's imagine cup for developing a RTS game called Isles. He goes by the screenname <strong>llml</strong> on freenode and can also be found at <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mengbiping" target="_blank">launchpad</a>.

Jiangfeng Peng (Jasekidd) is a computer science student at south china university of technology.  Jasekidd would be researching and identifying points of parallelization in drizzle runtime. Jay pipes and <a href="http://krow.net/" target="_blank">Brian Aker</a> would be mentoring Jasekidd during his work as Gsoc student. His major is high performance computing and multi threaded applications, in his spare time jasekidd likes to play badminton and basketball. He goes by the handle of jasepeng in IRC and launchpad. His project plans can be found at <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/GSOC_Parallelization_Runtime" target="_blank">drizzle wiki</a>.

Nathan Williams (nlw) is a final year student at DigiPen institute of technology, his major is real time interactive simulation. Nathan will be working on refactoring and custom List&lt;&gt; implementation with STL's list, vector and queue for drizzle under mentorship of <a href="http://e-monty.com/" target="_blank">Monty taylor</a>. Nathan comes from computer network and security background, his passtimes are no different than his work time as he whiles away time programming and gazing at maths. He can be found by the screen name nlw both on IRC and freenode. His project progress would be logged at his <a href="http://drizzle.org/wiki/GSOC_List_Replacement" target="_self">wiki page</a>. Sadly couldn't grab his picture as he doesn't have any recent clicks.

Being the first year in SOC, its pretty exciting that students have taken a liking to work on challenging problems; with a small community and friendly mailing list, I am sure this is going to be one of the most productive SOC year for even times to come. Drizzle being some 1000  revisions old and its problem solving  plans would benefit a lot from SOC and students who have joined in. All the best to students and thanks to all mentors :)
