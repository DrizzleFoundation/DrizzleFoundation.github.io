Drizzle source tarball, version 2011.05.18 has been released.

As a reminder, this is a development release of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/fremont">Fremont</a> series.  Our stable <a href="../../2011/04/2011/03/15/drizzle-2011-03-12-ga-tarball-has-been-released/">GA release</a> can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/+milestone/2011-03-14">here</a>.

Another somewhat thin release, but as you may have read, some of the team has been <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/05/16/percona-welcomes-stewart-smit/">moving</a> around <a href="http://www.wc220.com/?p=260">a bit</a>, but with things settling down, expect more goodness to come.  Also, a special thanks to <a href="http://openlife.cc/">Henrik Ingo</a> for taking the lead on several community tasks - his efforts and insights are a most welcome addition to the project!

In this release:
<ul>
	<li>json interface merged</li>
	<li>added backwards compatibility test to ensure we don't break table formats</li>
	<li>bug fixes</li>
	<li>continued code refactoring and improvement</li>
</ul>
The Drizzle download file can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/fremont/2011-05-23">here</a>.
