<div id="_mcePaste">Drizzle source tarball based on build 1717 has been released.</div>
<br></br>
<div id="_mcePaste">NOTE: Â New dependency introduced!</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We now require libboost-thread-dev to build.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~drizzle-developers/+archive/ppa">ppa</a> has been updated to reflect the change.</div>
<br></br>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for any inconvenience, but this gives us the following benefits:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> threads have scope safety</li>
	<li>boost threads are completely portable (no more worrying about that stuff)</li>
	<li>They will allow us to see what is happening with threads through the Performance Schema</li>
	<li>They will allow us to eventually get rid of per-session memory, which will allow us to do more with asynchronous scheduling inside the server.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br></br>
<div id="_mcePaste">In this release:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>continued work on embedded_innodb / <a href="http://www.haildb.com/">HailDB</a></li>
	<li>continued work on <a href="http://www.8bitsofbytes.com/?p=20">logging statistics</a></li>
	<li>continued work on updating the <a href="http://inaugust.com/post/81 ">options system</a></li>
