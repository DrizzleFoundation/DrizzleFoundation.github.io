There are a large number of <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/topic/Drizzle">Drizzle sessions</a> at this years' <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011">MySQL UC</a>.  If you want to know more about what you'll be using instead of MySQL in the very near future, come and check them out ; )

The team will be blogging individually about their various presentations in greater detail in the future, so keep an eye out on <a href="http://planetdrizzle.org/">Planet Drizzle</a>!

Additionally, the Friday after the conference will be <a href="http://blog.drizzle.org/2011/01/17/drizzle-developer-day-2011/">Drizzle Developer Day</a> .  It will be a good opportunity to learn more, provide feedback, etc
