I won't re-post what has already been said on the other blogs, but this seemed like a great central place to share the news.

After a couple months of trying to hunt down the mysterious little gnome causing headache to the team, it seems Eric stumbled upon the solution, probably in the shower, where all good ideas come to us. Take a look at his blog post for all the sexy statistics (last link) - I assume he did all the work after the shower, of course. Safety first, Eric!
