Drizzle source tarball based on build 1223 has been released.  This release contains some changes from Eric for the start of changes to the Drizzle protocol. You must now use --drizzle-protocol-port=N when starting drizzled instead of --port=N. See <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/drizzle-discuss/msg05405.html" target="_blank">his emails</a> for more details

The download file and change log can be found <a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle/trunk/bell" target="_blank">here</a>.
