<strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Our donation link was broken, but has been fixed.  Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Since it's inception in 2008 Drizzle has taken the approach of an open source community project. It's been run as a meritocracy by its developer community, with developers from various companies and just individuals. Even though at first Sun and then Rackspace did sponsor a core team to work full time on the project, the project is not owned by any particular company, but Drizzle is developed by a vibrant and diverse community. We've been proud to have between 20-40 active contributors each month.

With the first stable release in March 2011, interest in the project grew. At this point we also decided it was time to solidify and clarify the status of the project as a non-profit community project. Out of a couple options available, we chose to become an Associated Project at the <a href="http://spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>. The SPI is a charitable US non-profit corporations that acts as an <a href="http://spi-inc.org/projects/">umbrella organization to many open source projects</a>, including some well known ones like Debian and PostgreSQL. Drizzle was accepted as an SPI Associated Project by the Board on <a href="http://spi-inc.org/meetings/minutes/2011/2011-08-10/">August 10th</a>.

At this point, we would like to extend our gratitude to Josh Berkus (a PostgreSQL lead developer) who guided and sponsored Drizzle through the application process! We appreciate not just your experience and expertise with the SPI, but also the gesture of friendly help between two open source database projects.

Having a legal entity behind Drizzle has a number of useful benefits and any open source project that is bigger than just one or two guys should seriously consider using one of these umbrella organizations.

One benefit that is available to us starting this week is that you can now donate money to Drizzle via the SPI. The easiest way to donate is<a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46722"> using a credit card at Click &amp; Pledge</a>. The SPI website lists some <a href="http://spi-inc.org/donations/">alternative methods</a> such as using a cheque. For US tax payers donations are tax-deductible and if you are a business you can of course write the donation off as an expense.

Donations made via the SPI bank account will be properly accounted for by the SPI treasurer. Please read above links on how to "earmark" your donation for Drizzle. Available funds will be used by the Drizzle
project primary for expenses such as legal or IT infrastructure and secondary for arranging developer meetings and if possible sponsoring attendance at conferences. Note that if you want to sponsor development of Drizzle, such as a particular feature, and you have a large enough budget to be usable for that purpose, we recommend you rather contract such development directly via <a href="http://www.drizzle.org/content/support-and-services">one of the commercial service providers that employ Drizzle developers</a>.
